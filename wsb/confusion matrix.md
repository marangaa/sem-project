A confusion matrix is a table that shows how well a classifier or a test performed on a set of data with known outcomes. It compares the predicted values with the true values and counts how many times they match or mismatch. The confusion matrix for your code output is:

|            | Reference |   |
|------------|-----------|---|
| Prediction | 0         | 1 |
| 0          | 2         | 2 |
| 1          | 1         | 1 |

The confusion matrix can be used to calculate various statistics that measure the accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and other aspects of the classifier or test. Here are some definitions and formulas for the statistics in the code

- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correct predictions among all predictions. It is calculated as `(TP + TN) / (P + N)`, where TP is true positive, TN is true negative, P is condition positive, and N is condition negative. In your case, the accuracy is `(2 + 1) / (3 + 3) = 0.5`.
- **95% CI:** The 95% confidence interval for the accuracy. It is a range of values that has a 95% probability of containing the true accuracy of the population. It is calculated using a formula that depends on the sample size and the accuracy. In your case, the 95% CI is `(0.1181, 0.8819)`, which means that there is a 95% chance that the true accuracy of the classifier or test is between 0.1181 and 0.8819.
- **No Information Rate:** The proportion of the most frequent class in the data. It is the accuracy that would be achieved by a classifier or test that always predicts the most common outcome. It is calculated as `max(P, N) / (P + N)`. In your case, the no information rate is `max(3, 3) / (3 + 3) = 0.5`.
- **P-Value [Acc > NIR]:** The p-value for testing whether the accuracy is significantly greater than the no information rate. It is the probability of observing an accuracy as high or higher than the one obtained by the classifier or test, assuming that the null hypothesis (that the accuracy is equal to the no information rate) is true. It is calculated using a binomial test. In your case, the p-value is 0.6562, which means that there is a 65.62% chance of observing an accuracy of 0.5 or higher if the true accuracy is 0.5. This is not a very small p-value, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the classifier or test is better than random guessing.
- **Kappa:** The Cohen's kappa coefficient. It is a measure of agreement between the predicted values and the true values that takes into account the possibility of random agreement. It is calculated as `(accuracy - chance) / (1 - chance)`, where chance is the expected accuracy under the assumption of random agreement. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 means perfect agreement, 0 means agreement by chance, and -1 means perfect disagreement. In your case, the kappa is `(0.5 - 0.5) / (1 - 0.5) = 0`, which means that the agreement between the predicted values and the true values is equal to the agreement by chance.
- **Mcnemar's Test P-Value:** The p-value for testing whether the classifier or test is biased towards one type of error over another. It is the probability of observing a difference in the number of false positives and false negatives as large or larger than the one obtained by the classifier or test, assuming that the null hypothesis (that the classifier or test is unbiased) is true. It is calculated using a chi-squared test on the off-diagonal elements of the confusion matrix. In your case, the p-value is 1.0000, which means that there is a 100% chance of observing a difference of 1 or more between the false positives and false negatives if the true difference is 0. This is a very large p-value, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the classifier or test is biased.
- **Sensitivity:** The proportion of true positives among all condition positives. It is also known as recall or hit rate. It measures how well the classifier or test can identify the positive cases. It is calculated as `TP / P`. In your case, the sensitivity is `2 / 3 = 0.6667`.
- **Specificity:** The proportion of true negatives among all condition negatives. It measures how well the classifier or test can identify the negative cases. It is calculated as `TN / N`. In your case, the specificity is `1 / 3 = 0.3333`.
- **Pos Pred Value:** The proportion of true positives among all positive predictions. It is also known as precision. It measures how accurate the positive predictions are. It is calculated as `TP / (TP + FP)`. In your case, the pos pred value is `2 / (2 + 2) = 0.5`.
- **Neg Pred Value:** The proportion of true negatives among all negative predictions. It measures how accurate the negative predictions are. It is calculated as `TN / (TN + FN)`. In your case, the neg pred value is `1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5`.
- **Prevalence:** The proportion of condition positives in the data. It measures how common the positive cases are. It is calculated as `P / (P + N)`. In your case, the prevalence is `3 / (3 + 3) = 0.5`.
- **Detection Rate:** The proportion of positive predictions in the data. It measures how often the classifier or test predicts a positive outcome. It is calculated as `(TP + FP) / (P + N)`. In your case, the detection rate is `(2 + 2) / (3 + 3) = 0.6667`.
- **Detection Prevalence:** The proportion of positive predictions among all condition positives. It measures how well the classifier or test covers the positive cases. It is calculated as `(TP + FP) / P`. In your case, the detection prevalence is `(2 + 2) / 3 = 1.3333`.
- **Balanced Accuracy:** The average of sensitivity and specificity. It measures how well the classifier or test balances the trade-off between identifying the positive and negative cases. It is calculated as `(sensitivity + specificity) / 2`. In your case, the balanced accuracy is `(0.6667 + 0.3333) / 2 = 0.5`.
